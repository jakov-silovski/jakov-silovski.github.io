 Sound Breathing
Tengen Uzui Sound Breathing in Demon Slayer Anime and Manga

Anime viewers haven't been able to witness Tengen Uzui's Sound Breathing yet, but as one of the Hashira, it goes without saying that his technique would need to be a powerful one to earn him a spot among the elite demon slayers. Tengen, as an individual, brings more strength to the breathing style because of his sound analysis of his enemies' movements.RELATED:

Sound Breathing is derived from Thunder Breathing and is meant to disorient the enemy through the loudness of the movements of the user. It has five techniques, but only three have been revealed in Demon Slayer, those being First Form: Roar, Fourth Form: Constant Resounding Slashes, and Fifth Form: String Performance. They're all useful and exclusive to Tengen and his large, explosive Nichirin Katanas. Until Tengen fought the Upper Rank Six [demon], no one had ever survived a fight against his Sound Breathing technique.
