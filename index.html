            <h1>Demon Slayer: breathing techniques</h1>

            <p>
                Breathing Styles are swordsmanship styles that makes use of an esoteric breathing technique known as
                Total Concentration Breathing (全集中の呼吸 Zen Shūchū no Kokyū?) practiced and taught by members of the Demon
                Slayer Corps and are used in combat by Demon Slayers (later passed on as traditional dances post-time
                skip).<br><br>

                All known Breathing Styles currently taught within the Demon Slayer Corps are derived from Sun
                Breathing, the first one ever created. The majority of known Breathing Styles mimic a certain element of
                nature (i.e. flame, water and wind) and replicates it with the user's movements, techniques and
                abilities. The weapon attacks of Demon Slayers who use Breathing Styles are also longer ranged, possibly
                due to shockwaves or air pressure generated from their weapon itself when swinging and striking.<br><br>

                New Breathing Styles are always being created to suit a Demon Slayer's combat needs,[1] which results in
                new weapons being utilized in demon hunting (i.e. flails and whips). Such Breathing Styles embody a
                bigger variety of concepts, like animals, plants and emotions (i.e. serpents, flowers and love). When
                utilizing a Breathing Style, users automatically visualize themselves manipulating the subject behind
                their style, making it seem as if they were using magic, though those that are less apt and proficient
                in their style will visualize less of it than one who is.<br><br>

                It is possible to mix different Breathing Styles if the user cannot master one particular Breathing
                Style alone in order to use the stronger aspects of different styles to compensate. Tanjiro, realizing
                that he could not master Water Breathing like Giyu Tomioka nor could he handle the strain of Hinokami
                Kagura, showed to be able to combine the two techniques together in order to have stronger strikes than
                when he used Water Breathing alone and move for longer periods of time than if he used Hinokami Kagura
                alone. He did this to save Hinatsuru from Gyutaro[2], and later used it once again during the Infinity
                Castle Arc to slay dozens of demons. <br><br>
