As the name suggests, Flower Breathing is a breathing style that creates attacks, movements, and techniques that are based on flowers and fruits. It is one of the two techniques derived from Water Breathing, along with Serpent Breathing.

In the series, there are two known users of Flower Breathing, namely Kanae Kocho and Kanao Tsuyuri. While it creates graceful movements and attacks that could greatly damage enemies, it does have some drawbacks. A user is granted the ability to see the world in slow motion while using the breathing technique, at the cost of damaging their eyes in the long term. Because it can be detrimental to the user, there are other better breathing techniques to master.
