 Stone Breathing
Gyomei Himejima, Stone Breathing Hashira in Demon Slayer

A form that has only been seen in the manga so far, Stone Breathing is one of the five original styles derived from Sun Breathing. It has five known forms, all mastered by the Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima, though they weren't developed by him. Gyomei is often referred to by his fellow Hashira Tanjiro and Inosuke as the strongest Hashira. Being blind since birth allowed him to develop a connection with the Earth and to master Stone Breathing in only two months' time.

Stone Breathing has five techniques that mimic the earth and stone by using the ground beneath the user for sturdier attacks. The form itself would not be as powerful without a user like Gyomei, but it is one of the most unique, making it harder to master and a more unexpected technique.
