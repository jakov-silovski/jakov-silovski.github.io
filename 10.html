 Water Breathing
The Water Hashira Giyu Tomioka from Demon Slayer

Water Breathing is not only directly derived from Sun Breathing, but it has three variants of its own—Flower, Insect, and Serpent Breathing—all forms used by Giyu Tomioka's fellow Hashira. It is one of the more commonly-used Breathing Styles, having been cultivated by Sakonji Urokodaki and used by Tomioka, Murata, Sabito, Makomo, Tanjiro, and Aoi Kanzaki.

Water Breathing has 10 techniques plus the Eleventh Form, that being Dead Calm, which was developed and used exclusively by Tomioka. Like other breathing styles, Water Breathing is proven to be one of the strongest based on how its users have developed it. Fans have been lucky enough to witness every form used in the anime already as Tanjiro builds toward his family's Sun Breathing style.
