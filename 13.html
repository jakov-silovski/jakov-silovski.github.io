 Breath of the Sun

Tanjiro Kamado, the main protagonist voiced by Natsuki Hanae, will soon harness what is known as Hinokami Kagura, or Sun Breathing. It's the oldest and most powerful breathing style that was used to develop the Flame, Water, Moon, Thunder, Stone, and Wind Breathing techniques that demon slayers use to this day. It mimics the intensity and versatility of the sun, lessening a demon's ability to regenerate.

This breathing form remains a well-kept secret of the Kamado family. It has 13 techniques, and, unlike other styles, they aren't listed as "First Form" and so on, they are simply named for their movement such as, "Dragon Sun Halo Head Dance." Tanjiro has yet to master it, but he has begun to use it with his Water Breathing as a basis, and, when he channeled it, he said it increased his abilities even more than Water Breathing ever had.
