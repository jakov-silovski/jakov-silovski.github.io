 Beast Breathing
Inosuke spreading his arms in Demon Slayer.

Inosuke Hashibira, an erratic character voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, created Beast Breathing from Wind Breathing and is the only character to use it. This technique replicates how wild animals move about in nature, and it is meant to be unpredictable and primal. It has 10 "fangs," also known as forms, that help Inosuke picture different styles of claw-like slashes.
Inosuke created the Beast Breathing style while he survived with boars in isolation in the mountains. He seems like an erratic character who used the technique to go wild when fighting demons, but he also had to maintain an incredible sense of touch to be in tune with animalistic senses. This is evident in his fight against Enmu in the Demon Slayer movie.
